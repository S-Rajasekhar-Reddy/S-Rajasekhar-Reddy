### Hi there, I'm Sai 👋

I am a **Network Development Engineer** with **6 years** of experience. My expertise spans the full infrastructure lifecycle—from architecting secure enterprise networks (Routing, Switching, Firewalls) to building and deploying serverless cloud applications. I treat infrastructure as software, ensuring scalability through code and automation.

- 🔭 **Current Focus:**
  - **End-to-End Infrastructure:** Managing global backbones (BGP/OSPF), Firewalls (Fortinet/Palo Alto), VPNs, and securing Hybrid Cloud connectivity (On-Prem to AWS).
  - **DNS & Traffic Management:** Full lifecycle management across Route 53, Cloudflare, and GoDaddy.
  - **Cloud Native Development:** Designing serverless backends (Lambda, Python), managing databases (DynamoDB, MySQL, SQL/NoSQL), and handling migrations.
  - **App Deployment:** Implementing robust Git workflows and CI/CD pipelines to deploy cloud solutions.

- ☁️ **Certifications:**
  - AWS Certified Developer
  - AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
  - Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) - Enterprise
  - Cisco Certified DevNet Professional (CCNP DevNet)

- 🎓 **Education:** Master's in Computer Science (3.77 GPA).
